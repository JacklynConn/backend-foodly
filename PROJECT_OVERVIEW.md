# Backend-Foodly Project Overview

## üçî Project Description

**Backend-Foodly** is a comprehensive Node.js backend application designed for a food delivery platform. It provides a complete REST API solution that powers mobile and web applications for food ordering and delivery services, similar to popular platforms like Uber Eats, DoorDash, or Grubhub.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architectural pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Models**: Data schemas and database interactions
- **Controllers**: Business logic and request handling
- **Routes**: API endpoint definitions and middleware
- **Middleware**: Authentication, authorization, and request processing

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Core Framework & Server
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building REST APIs
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **Body-parser**: Middleware for parsing request bodies
- **Compression**: HTTP response compression for better performance

### Database & Data Management
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for flexible data storage
- **Mongoose**: Object Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB

### Authentication & Security
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Stateless authentication
- **Crypto-js**: Password hashing and encryption
- **Role-based Access Control**: Multiple user types with different permissions

### Communication & Notifications
- **Firebase Admin SDK**: Push notifications and user management
- **Nodemailer**: Email service for notifications and verification

### Development & Configuration
- **Nodemon**: Development server with auto-restart
- **Dotenv**: Environment variable management

## üë• User Roles & Permissions

The system supports four distinct user types with different access levels:

1. **Client**: End customers who place orders
2. **Admin**: System administrators with full access
3. **Vendor**: Restaurant owners who manage their establishments
4. **Driver**: Delivery personnel who handle order fulfillment
